Nominees compete against their peers from around the world in a series of local and national competitions in hopes to qualify for the GSEA Global Finals. GSEA delivers on its vision to empower student entrepreneurs to become the world\\u2019s most influential change makers by supporting student entrepreneurs who require much-needed mentorship, recognition and connections to take their businesses to the next level of succes</em>s.</p>\\n   <p><a href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1357329444752107\\\">Arnold Shoko</a> of Tanzania is the CEO and co-founder of Samaki Farms, a company that transforms food waste into protein feeds. In the <a href=\\\"https://hub.eonetwork.org/Web/About%20Public/EO-Press-Releases/Irish-Business-Founder-Nick-Cotter-Wins--2022-Global-Student-Entrepreneur-Awards.aspx\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">2022 GSEA Global Finals</a>, Arnold Shoko won the Together We Grow Award for his collaborative spirit. We asked Arnold about his GSEA experience. Here\\u2019s what he shared:</p>\\n   <h4 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Tell us about your company, Samaki Farms.&nbsp;</strong></h4>\\n   <p>At Samaki Farms, we produce alternative protein feed ingredients using black soldier fly larvae. We are an Insect-Tech startup. We offer larvae as an alternative protein feed ingredient, and we also offer consultation services to fish farmers around the country. We transform organic food waste into richly nutrient insect protein feed for fish. We make sustainable feed for a cleaner world.</p>\\n   <p>I started my business following my long-term commitment and passion for fisheries and agriculture\\u2014two things that define me. My team and I identified a big opportunity in fish farming. We realized fish farmers needed good options to lower production costs. That sparked the idea to produce alternative protein feed for fish farmers and fish feed manufacturers. I thought, \\u201cWe have a lot of food waste; how can I use this waste in growing feed?\\u201d</p>\\n   <p>Now I work with a team of six people on a mission to build scalable and innovative solutions for providing alternative protein ingredients for fish feeds in Tanzania. I\\u2019m fulfilling my childhood dream!</p>\\n   <h4 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>How did you discover the GSEA competition?</strong></h4>\\n   <p>I saw an ad for <a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/eo_gsea/\\\">GSEA on Instagram</a>. I thought, \\u201cWhat is this? Is this for me?\\u201d Then I found EO Tanzania and learned that they were hosting a GSEA competition for the whole country. That\\u2019s where I met my friend <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paacmJrrl4w\\\">David Denis</a>\\u2014the 2021 GSEA global runner-up. He encouraged me to apply. I knew I had to go for it.</p>\\n   <blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\\\">\\n    <p>Are you a student entrepreneur who is ready to take your business to the next level? The 2022/23 GSEA competition season is open. <a href=\\\"https://www.gsea.org/apply\\\">Apply today!</a></p>\\n   </blockquote>\\n   <h4 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>Did EO members help you hone your GSEA presentation?</strong></h4>\\n   <p>Yes, I felt so lucky! I found four amazing mentors from EO Tanzania: Baraka Mtunga, Miranda Naiman, Emir Karamagi, and Sabrina Othman. They helped me improve my presentation. I would send the presentation for their feedback, and they asked about a lot of details. So I would work on it again and repeat the process.</p>\\n   <p>The GSEA competition process helped me realize that what I\\u2019m bringing to the world isn\\u2019t just a presentation\\u2014it\\u2019s a company.</p>\\n   <p>My mentors helped me realize the potential of what I\\u2019m doing. As a student, I didn\\u2019t dream that big. The time I spent meeting them was so valuable. My mentors encouraged me and advised me on how to reach out to other companies in the industry.</p>\\n   <p>We are now marketing, branding, and using proper Samaki Farms packaging for our feeds. We are no longer a mediocre business\\u2014 we are now a proper business with huge potential!</p>\\n   <h4 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>You are the 2022 GSEA Together We Grow winner. How did you earn that award?&nbsp;</strong></h4>\\n   <p>I was honored to receive the award, which goes to a student who fosters community and demonstrates concern for others while fully engaging in and contributing to the GSEA programme.</p>\\n   <p>I have always had a strong sense of bringing people together and involving others. There were over 60 student competitors in the GSEA Global Finals. As student entrepreneurs, we all face similar struggles in our individual companies. We had a sense of belonging together and a feeling that no matter who won, our common bond would remain after the competition. I made many new friends from other countries, and even now, after the competition is over, we keep on communicating.</p>\\n   <p>I received a US$4,000 grant as the Together We Grow winner. My EO mentors advised me to use 90 percent of it to increase production and put 10 percent toward operations. While the amount of money may seem small to some people, to us, it is huge. Because of that money, other investors are more willing to invest in our company. It is a huge advantage that the GSEA award has provided to us.</p>\\n   <h4 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>How has your business changed since the GSEA competition?</strong></h4>\\n   <p>We have doubled production and now have two proper breeding houses. We are also running operations quite differently. This expansion would not be possible without the funds.</p>\\n   <p>Through GSEA, I connected with people in different parts of the world who encouraged me to explore additional food wastes such as those from fast food, grab-and-bites, and vegetable markets. Now we\\u2019re expanding with a plan to build capacity; we see our target production as 1,000 tons. I got all of that motivation from GSEA. It\\u2019s quite a new mindset for me.</p>\\n   <h4 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>What were your takeaways from GSEA&nbsp;Global Finals?</strong></h4>\\n   <p>My most significant takeaway from GSEA is that I need to think big. And then, even bigger!</p>\\n   <p>I had never entered any other competition before GSEA. It gave me so much motivation. I didn\\u2019t even know I could do all of this expansion and attract investors. My business will be a big thing in the future because of GSEA and everything I learned from the programme.</p>\\n   <p>My EO mentors still encourage and advise me. My background is as a scientist, not a business person. I recently met with some potential investors. My EO mentors graciously advised me how to behave, how to interact, and afterward, how to proceed.</p>\\n   <p>GSEA is not about the prize money (although that is significant!). It\\u2019s about growth and learning. The EO mentors I connected with really want and wish for me to grow; they are with me throughout the process.</p>\\n   <h4 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\"><strong>What do you say to student entrepreneurs who may consider entering the GSEA&nbsp;competition?&nbsp;</strong></h4>\\n   <p>I\\u2019ve already spoken about GSEA to many people, including a group of students who run startups in Dar es Salaam. I told them to apply. I am a full-time GSEA alumni and ambassador\\u2013encouraging others to experience what I\\u2019ve experienced.</p>\\n   <p>Participating in GSEA is a great way to understand business, learn how to run a company, and build communications skills. All of these things are far more important than the funds alone. Everything that our company has grown into is a result of GSEA\\u2014I feel so lucky that I found it!</p>\\n   <p>You can view the 2022 GSEA Global Finalists\\u2019 journeys by subscribing to the <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/c/GSEAcompetition\\\">GSEA YouTube channel</a> and watching the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/hashtag/startitup?__eep__=6%2F&amp;__tn__=*NK\\\">#STARTITUP</a>&nbsp;miniseries, which details the 2022 competitors\\u2019 journeys.</p>\\n   <p>If you are a student entrepreneur who is ready to take your business to the next level, the 2022/23 GSEA competition season is open. <a href=\\\"https://www.gsea.org/apply\\\">Apply today!</a></p>\\n   <p><a><em>For more insights and inspiration from today\\u2019s leading entrepreneurs, check out&nbsp;</em></a><a href=\\\"https://www.inc.com/author/entrepreneurs-organization\\\"><em>EO on Inc.</em></a><em>&nbsp;and more articles from the&nbsp;</em><a href=\\\"https://blog.eonetwork.org/\\\"><em>EO blog</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>\\n  </div>\\n </div>\\n</section>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In reality, we are in the business of helping financially empowered clients, whether business owners, families or individual clients, to reach their hopes and goals.</p>\\n   <p><strong><em>How has EO helped you get through a specific business challenge?</em></strong></p>\\n   <p>When I started Glen Eagle Advisors, I wanted to build a company that was about values first.&nbsp; As a mother who raised four children while building my own book of business,<span id=\\\"more-15653\\\"></span> I wanted other women and male advisors who were leaving the industry because they were told that one had to lean into work 110% or you shouldn\\u2019t be an advisor. I had successfully built an advisory business while pursuing a much different path; a path summarized by Glen Eagle\\u2019s strategic vision of Faith, Family and Firm \\u2026 in that order! This centralized north star has made our advisors and employees better able to relate and advise our clients. I have found the discussions that I have had over time with my Forum are invaluable, especially on how to be true to our values and deal with employees that do not really live our values.</p>\\n   <p><strong><em>What were you looking for in an organization when you selected EO?</em></strong></p>\\n   <p>I was an educator before becoming a financial advisor. I then spent 13 years as an independent financial advisor before deciding to start Glen Eagle Advisors in 2002.&nbsp; While I was successful in building and growing Glen Eagle Advisors prior to joining EO, I always felt that my business education was basically self-taught.&nbsp; I sought and found that both the Forum experience and the learning events have exceeded my expectations.</p>\\n   <p>Learn more about the <a rel=\\\"noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.eonetwork.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Entrepreneurs\\u2019 Organization</a> and <a rel=\\\"noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.eonetwork.org/why-join/apply-for-membership-form\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">apply for membership</a> today!</p>\\n  </div>\\n </div>\\n</section>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
